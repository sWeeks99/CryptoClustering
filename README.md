# CryptoClustering

My name is Sean Weeks, this is my submission repository for the Module 19 Challenge.

This repository includes the main Jupyter Notebook and Python code focused on unsupervised learning to analyze whether cryptocurrencies are influenced by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 
Resources contains CSV file for cryptocurrency market data.

-XPert Learning Assistant was used to review and troubleshoot our code as needed.
